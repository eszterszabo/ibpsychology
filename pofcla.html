<b><u><h2>1. Humans are information processers, whose mental processes guide their behaviour</h2> </u></b>
<br>
<p> Humans process information that surrounds them, and learn from that information. 
From this information that surrounds us, we are able to deduct how we should behave and what 
actions we should take, as well as what we should think. This applies even if there is a limited
amount of information, and we are pressured to make decisions and further observations 
about the situation, based on the examples.  <br>
This is one of the key principles that lead to the development of 
<a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci%20IA/schema.html" target="_blank">Schema Theory</a> .

<b><u><h2>2. The mind can be studied scientifically </h2> </u></b>
<br>
<p> 
There are several ways in which the human mind can be studied scientifically, including 
scientific studies, such as those conducted in laboratories, different types of 
<a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci%20IA/tech.html" target="_blank">brain 
imaging technologies</a>, and other qualitative and quantitative research methods. <br>
The reason for using scientific research to study the mind is that results from research such as scans
can be relatively easily generalised, as especially in the case of scans, the results are not
influenced by bias.

<b><u><h2>3. Cognitive functions can be influenced by cultural factors </h2> </u></b>
<br>
<p> Memory, as well as other processes in the brain may depend on and be influenced by 
cultural factors. These factors may be like the previously mentioned
 <a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci%20IA/schema.html" target="_blank">schemas</a>, or
  factors such as emotional connections to specific events. <br>
  One example of how cultural factors may influence memory was demonstrated in Brown et al´s 
  study of <a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci%20IA/emotion.html" target="_blank">Flashbulb memory</a>
  . Although this was  not a cross cultural study, it could be assumed
  that the participants had such vivid memories of the assassination of JFK because the study
  was conducted in the USA.     </p>
