<p> When looking at ethical considerations, a number of factors must be taken into account and a 
number of steps must be taken in order to ensure that studies are as ethically correct as possible. 
Some of these that must be in place are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Informed consent</li>
<li>Protection from harm</li>
<li>Anonymity and confidentiality </li>
<li>Debriefing</li>
<li>Right to withdraw</li>
</ul>
<p>
Although for some studies the lack of one of these, to some extent, might be justified, it 
is important to keep in mind that all of the following can be used as key points of discussion
when evaluating any research study. <br>
It is also important to know that ethical consideration do not apply to animals, and in the 
past, even when conducting experiments on humans, their importance was often not recognised. 
Furthermore, if the participants are underage, the parents or legal guardians must be the ones 
asked for their consent.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<b>Dr. Money, 1974</b> - In the case of Money, there was no initial aim or idea for the research, 
but instead he took an opportunity that presented itself to him. <br>
He was contacted by the parents of two young, twin boys, one of whom had his penis burnt
 off in a circumcision accident. The parents asked for advice on what they should do, and Money told them 
 that they should castrate the boy and turn him into a girl. Following this, Money wrote a 
 book on this case. 
 <br> Although in this case one might think that the harming of the boy might be the biggest ethical
 issue, as it may cause him psychological trauma to be raised as a girl, the real issue was with the book,
 as Money did not ask for the parents permission when writing and publishing the book, breaching 
 doctor-patient confidentiality.

<i>
<b>Bandura et al , 1961: The Bobo doll experiment</b> - The aim of this study was to investigate how 
social factors influence cognition and memory. <br>
In this experiment, children were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 saw adults playing nicely 
with the Bobo doll, whereas participants in Group 2 witnessed adults being violent with the 
Bobo doll, kicking and punching it. Following this, each child was put into a room with the Bobo doll.
<br>
The results showed that children who observed the violently behaving adults were also more
likely to punch and kick the Bobo doll. This may cause some ethical problems, as this aggressive 
behaviour may be harmful for the child in the future, as it is not shown whether this behaviour
is only displayed in short term, or would last for a longer time. <br>
However, as the participants were all children, it is assumed that all the parents agreed to 
taking part in the experiment, and all the other ethical considerations were followed. It is 
important to keep in mind that when talking about an experiment related to ethical considerations 
the study does not have to have any problems; it is okay to discuss a very fell done experiment.
