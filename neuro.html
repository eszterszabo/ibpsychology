Neurotransmission is the process of neurons signalling each other, it order to make the brain and other
parts of the body carry out certain processes.  <br>
As the IB requires students to know the effect of two types of neurotransmitter on human behaviour,
this answer will only examine the role of Acetylchlorine (ACh) on memory, and the effect of 
serotonin on mood. <br>
<b>ACh</b> is a neurotransmitter in the brain that is responsible for memory formation and retrieval. 
<b>Serotonin</b> is a neurotransmitter found in animals, plants, fungi and humans, responsible for
mood and feelings, and related actions, such as aggression.  
</p>

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Suomi et al</b> - The aim of this study was to investigate how  the amount of serotonin 
that a monkey can process affects the monkey´s aggression levels.
In this experiment, the researchers extracted some of the cerebral spinal fluid of monkeys, 
and looked at how much serotonin they were able to process. 
<br>
The results showed that monkeys that could not process serotonin properly displayed more aggressive
behaviour than those who were able to process it normally. 
This research also supports the theory that genetic predisposition plays a role in the display of
agression.

<p>
<i>
<b>Martinez and Kesner, 1991</b> - The aim of this study was to investigate how the amounts 
of acetylchlorine affect memory formation.  <br>
This study was conducted using 3 groups of rats. The levels of ACh were <u> reduced</u> 
in <b>Group 1 </b>. The levels of ACh were <u> kept normal</u>, for control in <b>Group 2. </b>
And the levels of ACh were <u>increased</u>  in <b>Group 3 </b>.
The task of the rats was to go through a maze, and the time it took for them to get through it was
measures. <br>
The researchers forund that the rats in <b>Group 1</b> did the worst, and  rats in <b>Group 3</b>
did the best. This showed that by increasing the levels of ACh, memory formation can be stimulated.
