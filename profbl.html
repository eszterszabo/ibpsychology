<b><u><h2>1. Animal reseach can provide insight into human behaviour</h2> </u></b>
<br>
<p> There are types of research that for ethical, or other reasons can not be carried out 
on humans, but would otherwise be important for medical applications. <br>
In these cases some types of animal research can provide useful data. However, in order for 
these types of researches to be succesful, those conducting the study must carefully analyse 
the aspects, body parts or other properties of animals that they study, in order to be able to 
choose an animal with the properties closest to that of humans, for the data to later be applicable. 
</p>

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</i></h4>
<p><i>
<b>Martinez and Kessner, 1991</b> - They wanted to see how the activity levels of the 
neurotransmitter acetylchlorine (ACh) would effect the memory of mice, as they had to go 
trough a maze several times. The 3 groups of mice had they ACh performace decreased, left 
as normal and increased. They found that those mice whos ACh activity was increased performed 
the best, and those whose  was decreased perforemd the worst. </i>

<b><u><h2>2. There are biological explanations of behaviour </h2> </u></b>
<br>
<p> To some extent, aspects of both animal and human behaviour can be explained by biological factors. 
This principle is supported by research into hormonal functions and neurotransmitters, as well as brain functions. <br>
This principle assumes that people are born with certain qualities (eg. tendency to act violent). 
</p>

<h4><i>RESEARCH:</i></h4>
<p><i>
<b>Raine et al, 1997</b>- Using PET scans, Raine examined the brains of murderers and
 non-murderers, using a matched pair design. The reaserch showed that the brains of murderers 
 had less activity in areas responsible for self-control, rationality and emotional expression, 
 compared to their non-murderer pairs.

<b><u><h2>3. To some extent, human behaviour is genetically based </h2> </u></b>
<br>
<p> According to this principle, our genetic build-up and the way our body is developed may, 
to some extent, influence the way we behave. Tjis may include inherited behavioural trades, 
or new ones that we ourselves have genetically developed throughout our growth.  </p>

  
  
  
<h4><i>RESEARCH:</i></h4>
<p><i>
<b>Bouchard et al, 1990s</b>-  Bouchard conducted research on monozygotic twins, and how their IQs
 would change if they were raised together or apart. He found that the IQs of the twins 
 would be approximately the same, regardless if they were raised  together or apart, leading
  him to the conclusion that their IQs were genetically based. </i>
