<p>
Social and cultural factors have a great influence on our behaviour and memory; they affect 
not only the way our memories are formed, but also the types of memories that we are likely to
form. <br>
Some examples of this can be seen in the way that <a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci IA/emotion.html" target="_blank">
emotion affects</a> our memory, like in the case of African americans remembering freedom fighters more clearly ( Brown et al), 
which is due to the fact that because of their culture they also have stronger connections with them. <br>
A second example can be seen in <a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci%20IA/schema.html" target="_blank">schema theory</a>, 
with the example of the War of the Ghosts, where participants´ memories of the storie altered to fit 
their cultural norms.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Misty and Rogoff, 1994</b> - The aim of this study was to see how types of memories can actually 
differ based on the cultural contexts that people grow up in.  <br>
This study investigated how different demands for different activities and memories may effect what memories 
people store. One example of this was this cultural investigation in New Guinea, where the researchers found that
elders were able to recall lines of descent and history very accurately, because this was used to solve many conflicts within their tribes.
Hence, it can be seen that this sort of an accurate recall was possible in these tribes as a result for its cultural demand.
