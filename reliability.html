Due to the fact that memories are very difficult to study, it is also difficult to determine the 
extent of their reliability and the level to which they can be altered. Two further factors that add to the 
unreliability to memories are the fact that they are reconstructed every time we try to 
recall them, and that they are actually formed following the events that aree their subjects, 
making the memory itself vulnerable to alteration in case of an outside factor that occurs shortly 
within the event of the memory. <br> Because of this idea of the "flexibility" of our memory, 
research often focuses on the extent to which new memories can be planted in our brains, as well as to 
what extent can already present memories be altered.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Loftus and Palmer, 1974</b> - The aim of this study was to look into the reliability of 
eyewitness testimony and memory accuracy.  <br>
In this experiment participants were shown a video of a car crash that they later had to describe. 
Apart from the actual crash, other details were asked about the accident, to see how many details 
observers would notice if that is not what they were asked to concentrate on. The point of this was
to show that bystanders during an accident, when not paying attention to the actual event of the accident, 
wold give inaccurate and unreliable testimonies. 
<br>
The results proved that the theory was right, and that memory can be easily mislead, 
especially when people <i> want to remember </i> an event that they dont have an accurate memory of.
