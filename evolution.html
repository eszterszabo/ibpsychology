The ideas of Darwin´s Theory of Evolution are greatly present in psychological research, as
there ar many research theories based around the idea of how we developed into what we are today. 
He theorised that for our development it is necessary for us and all other organisms to face challenges in life, 
which challenges either kill us or make us stronger. 
These challenges, and the level to which the organisms can cope with these, will either make
 an organism adapt to face this challenge, or will result in the death of the species if
 it is unable to evolve, and incapable of taking on these challenges.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Fessler et al, 2005 </b> - The aim of this study was to examine the sensitivity and
 disgust levels of pregnant women during different stages in their pregnancies <br>
 To investigate this, a web-based survey was conducted, which asked women to self-report,
  based on answering questions about their level of disgust in different areas, such as food and hygiene. 
<br>The results were not unexpected: women reported having been more sensitive to body products 
and food during the first trimester than during the second and third trimesters. 
The explanation for this is that food-borne diseases are the most dangerous to pregnant 
women during their first trimester of pregnancy. As a result, women evolved to have the
 instinct to naturally be more cautious, and reject more foods, that could possibly cause them
  any problems, complications, or pose a danger to the fetus.
