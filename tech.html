Modern technology is an important tool for showing and even proving psychological phenomena. 
Examples of technology that can be used to show cognitive and biological factors that affect 
the way humans think and feel are MRI and fMRI scanners, PET scanners, and CAT scanners. <br>
These same pieces of technology are also used in the biological level of analysis.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Kilts et al, Coca Cola or Pepsi? </b> - The aim of this study was to investigate how
a beverage that we like effects our brains.  <br>
In this experiment MRI scans were used to look at people´s brains when they were drinking 
Coke and when they were drinking Pepsi.  <br>
The results showed that when people drank the product that they perviously said they 
preferred, the parts of the brain that relate to one´s personality lit up on the scan. 
<br>
This showed that people preferred the drink that they personally identified with.

<u><h4>Other research that could be mentioned in relation to cognition and technology:</u></h4>

 <p>The case study of HM, which used MRI scans to study his brain, from which his hippocampus was
 removed, in order to cure his epilepsy. <br>
 Reine et al´s study of criminals´ brains, that used PET scans, which is described in the 
 <a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci%20IA/locoffunc.html" target="_blank">Localization of Functions</a>
 chapter, in the Biological Level of Analysis.
