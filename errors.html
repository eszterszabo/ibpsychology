<p> 
When attributing either our own or someone else´s traits, we often tend to make unconscious mistakes, 
which will usually favour our own beliefs and ideas in one way or another. <br> Although there
are many more than these, it is not required from the IB to know any more than 2 for any question.

<b><u><h2>Fundamental attribution bias  </h2> </u></b>
<p> The Fundamental attribution error (FAE) refers to the idea that when looking at other
 peoiple´s behaviour , if we don´t know them well, we tend to believe that all that they do 
 is due to dispositional factors. This is due to the fact that it will help us get a more general
 idea of their average behaviour. <br>
 To give an example, when Larry is late, it is easier to think that it must be because <i> he is 
 always late </i>, which would give us a basic idea of his personality, rather that think that 
 Larry may have been late because of many-many random little situational factors, such as his 
 fiancé dying, his car breaking down or his father having a heart attack.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Jones and Harries, 1967</b> - The aim of this experiment was to see if telling people that there
was a situational factor to someone doing something would change their views of that person´s 
behaviour, or is they would still think that despite that factor, the person´s behaviour was dispositional. 
<br>
Participants were given a pro-Castro essay to read. Half of the participants were told beforehand that 
the writer was instructed to write it as pro-Castro.  The participants were then asked if
they thought that the writer himself was pro-Castro or not. <br>
The results showed that regardless of whether participants were told that the writer was 
instructed to write it that way or not, all participants believed that the writer himself was
pro-Castro. This shows that even tose who knew of the situational factor overlooked it, as it
made characterising the writer, and forming a more general idea of him easier.

<b><u><h2>Self-serving bias </h2> </u></b>
<p>
Self-serving bias means that we tend to attribute behaviours to either dispositional or 
situational factors based on which is better for us in the situation. Most generally, when 
looking a one of our positive trait, we will see it as dispositional, and if we do something not so good, 
we would say that that is due to a situational factor. <br>
This bias would further apply in the case  of stereotypes, where because we want to see someone 
in a certain light, we often think that traits that do not match the stereotype are situational, 
whereas the traits that do match it are dispositional. 
<br>
<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Lau and Russel, 1980</b> - The aim of this study was to investigate how athletes would assess
their performance after a sports competition.<br>
The research found that when describing their performance, in case of a win, athletes would attribute 
their success to dispositional factors (eg. I played really well because i trained a lot.). Whereas
when they lost they often attributed it to situational factors (eg. The weather was bad.). <br>
This shows that people tend to attribute behaviour to either situational or dispositional factors based
on what favours them in a certain situation, meaning that there is a bias in the way they attribute
traits of behaviour.
