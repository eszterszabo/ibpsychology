Situational and dispositional factors refers to the idea that we often make assumptions about
people and situations based on very little knowledge. One example could be Larry being late to his job interview. 
In this situation the boss who is interviewing Larry may assume that Larry is late because he has the dispositional 
factor of always being late wherever he goes. When, in reality, Larry´s fiancé died during the night, 
and he had to take care of the dead body when he found it in the morning. This means that in reality
the reason for Larry being late was the situational factor of his fiancé´s death, and he does not in fact 
have the dispositional factor of always being late.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Lau and Russel, 1980</b> - The aim of this study was to investigate how athletes would assess
their performance after a sports competition.<br>
The research found that when describing their performance, in case of a win, athletes would attribute 
their success to dispositional factors (eg. I played really well because i trained a lot.). Whereas
when they lost they often attributed it to situational factors (eg. The weather was bad.). <br>
This shows that people tend to attribute behaviour to either situational or dispositional factors based
on what favours them in a certain situation. 
</i></p>
<br>
<p>
One explanation for this, which was given by Jones and Davies in 1965, is that attributing 
dispositional factors not only helps us understand the way people behave, but it also helps us predict
future behaviours that someone might depict. <br>
With the same example of Larry, if he does in fact  have the dispositional trait of always being late,
his fiancé´s parents might ask him to arrive to the funeral at 6, when it really only starts at 
7, because they assume that he will be late anyways. 
<br>
<br>
One possibly problematic outcome of this might be the forming of often negative

 we will then apply to a seemingly similar group of people  ( eg. Larry´s family).
