<b><u><h2>1. Humans are social beings with a need to belong</h2> </u></b>
<br>
<p> 
This means that people generally feel the motivation to form relationship with those who are around
them. This includes friendships as well as sexual relationships. This derives from the evolutionary idea that
as a group, together people are stronger, which helps them to survive and be able to reproduce.
<br>
This idea will further be discussed in the <a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci%20IA/SIT.html" target="_blank">
Social Identity Theory</a> section.

<b><u><h2>2. Culture influences behaviour </h2> </u></b>
<br>
<p> 
This principle is one that is very simple, but ties very strongly to the third principle. As
probably all of us have noticed, we behave differently depending on our cultural backgrounds and what are considered to
be the norms in the places where we come from. <br>
One very simple example of this is tipping the waiter at a restaurant. In the US this is not 
only a common practice, but one that is expected. On the other hand, in Japan tipping
a waiter is considered to be rude, as waiters are paid to do their jobs and are expected to do it well without any extra incentive. <br>
One study that can be used to demonstrate this is the way people changed the story of War of
the Ghosts in Bartlett´s <a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci%20IA/schema.html" target="_blank">
Schema theory</a> experiment.

<b><u><h2>3. Humans have a social membership which reflects their group membership </h2> </u></b>
<br>
<p> 
As the first principle states,, humans have a need to belong, which leads to the formation of groups. 
When these groups are formed, those who belong to it will often, to some extent, change their behaviour 
( aka. conform) to match that of the rest of the group, and to what the group expects them to 
behave like. This helps people secure their position in the group, and stay in the "in-groups".
Those who do not belong to the said groups are known as "out-groups", about which the said in-group will 
often form stereotypes, and which will often be discriminated against. 
<br>
This is further discussed in the section <a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci%20IA/conform.html" target="_blank">
Conformity in Groups</a>.
