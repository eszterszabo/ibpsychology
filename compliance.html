<p> 
Compliance techniques refers to ways in which researchers often persuade people to take part in a study, 
or convince them to do something, often through emotional games. This is achieved through a direct request from 
one person towards another person. 

</p>
<br>

<b><u><h2>Lowballing </h2> </u></b>
<p> This technique involves the changing of an offer that we are willing to give to the participant,
after they have already agreed to doing it. <br> A simple example is telling someone that 
they will get a free meal if they give blood, but after they have already agreed to giving
 blood, you tell them that they only get a chocolate. <br> This technique is often effective
  because people will not want to admit that they only agreed to doing something good ( like
   giving blood) only for the reward they get for it, but will want to keep up the image that
    they are doing it for the greater good. 
  </p>

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<b>Burger and Cornelius, 2003</b> - The aim of this study was to test the extent of this 
compliance technique and to see if people would still agree to the charitable act even without a prize.  <br>
In this experiment, a female researcher called students, asking them if they were willing to donate
$5 to a fund that raises money for scholarships for underprivileged children. The students were also told that 
they would get a free smoothie coupon if they agreed to donate. The <b>first group</b> of students 
were told that they have ran out of smoothie coupons only after they have agreed to donating the money, 
and after being told this 76% still agreed to donating. The  <b>second group</b>  were interrupted before
they could answer, and were told that they have ran out of coupons. Only 16% of them agreed to donate.
A <b>third, control group</b> was simply asked for donations, without any mention of a reward. 
42% of this group agreed to the donation. 
<br> 
This experiment shows that compliance was the highest in the first group, where the lowballing technique was applied. 
It further showed that when participants were already expecting to get a price in exchange, 
they were less likely to  participante with no prize, than if they had no expectations at all. 
This was demonstrated through the comparison of the second group versus the control group.

<b><u><h2>Foot-in-the-door Technique </h2> </u></b>
<p>
The aim of this compliance technique is to first get people to agree to do small things, which they 
will likely be okay with doing, before asking them for a large request. The use of this is that 
after agreeing to small requests, and already knowing the person who is asking for participants to 
do the thing, people will also be less likely to reject larger requests.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Freedman and Faser , 1966</b> - The aim of this study was to test whether asking people
for small favours will lead them to later complying to larger requests.  <br>
First, a group of homeowners in California were asked if they would put up a large and ugly sign 
saying "drive carefully" in their front gardens. Only 17% of them agreed to it. <br>
Next, a second groups of Californian homeowners were asked if they would be okay with a much smaller 
"be a safe driver" sign in their gardens, to which almost all agreed. Two weeks later, these participants
were also asked if they would display the much larger, ugly "drive carefully" sign. This 
time 76%  of participants agreed to displaying it.<br>
This shows that this technique does in fact work, as after already completing a small favour,
people were more likely to comply to doing a much larger one.
