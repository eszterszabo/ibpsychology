<p> When looking at genetic inheritance, it is best to look at studies that either involve 
parents and their children, siblings or monozygotic twins (MZT). MZTs are the most used in this
type of research because as their genes are fully identical, their other behavioural attributes
 can easily be compared and related back to their genetic inheritance. 
<br>
Through genetic traits behaviours such as aggression, nurturing behaviour in mothers, or intelligence
(based on IQ levels) are areas that are often studied.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<b>Bouchard et al, 1990: The Minnesota twin study</b> - This study aimed to look at how much
the environment, and how much genetics are responsible for the IQ levels of twins. <br>
For this, Bouchard looked at over 100 pairs of identical and non-identical twins, who were 
raised either apart and together. Approximately 50 hours were spent on the testing of twins by researchers. 
<br>
Bouchard concluded that approximately 70% of intelligence can be attributed to genetics, and 
30% of it can be attributed to environmental factors.

<p>
<b>Suomi ans Lesch, 1996</b> -The aim of this study was to see if monkeys´ ability to process
 serotonin had an effect on their levels of aggression. 
<br>
For this, first, Suomi ans Lesch identified the gene that was responsible for the processing of serotonin
in juvenile monkeys. Then they looked at whether there was a correlation between the monkeys´ 
abilities to process serotonin ( by taking samples from their cerebral spinal fluids), and the 
levels of aggression that they displayed. <br>
They found a strong correlation between the monkeys´ inability to process serotonin and 
their heightened levels of aggressive behaviour.
