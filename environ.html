Although the effects of the environment are mostly studied in the Sociocultural level of analysis, 
its importance also shows on some biological level, especially when looking at development and
growth. This topic could be further studied of the class chooses the

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Rosenzweig and Bennet, 1972 </b> - The aim of this study was to look at the effects 
of environment on brain plasticity ( the way the brain develops). <br>
 This research was conducted on rats, by putting them in different environment: environments
  where they were surrounded by stimuli such as toys, or ones with no stimuli whatsoever. 
  Stimuli included toy surrounding them, as well as other rats, and humans playing with them. 
  This study was conducted on young rats, to see how their brains would develop with or
   without being stimulated. The results showed that rats who were raised in stimulus-rich 
   environments developed more grey matter than those who had no stimuli around them. 
<br>
As this is area of the brain is responsible for functions such as motor control, emotional 
 control, decision making and memory, it plays an important role in future learning and 
 development. Henceforth, as this study is also applicable to humans, the information it 
 provides is of  great importance for parents to be, as it shows the advantage of encouraging
 their children to play, and encouraging them to do lots of activities.
