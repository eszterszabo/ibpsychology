<br>




<p> The hormons we produce (or take) can have serious effects on our physical development
 as well as our behaviour. It is commonly known that men and women produce many different 
 hormones, however , for the sake of simplicity we will only look at hormones that both 
 sexes produce, regardless of the quantities produced by each sex, and the amount that is 
 needed for each sex to feel the effect of the hormones. 
<br>
The IB requires psychology students to know the functions of <b>TWO</b> hormones, with
 studies for each. 

</p>
<br>
<hr>
<b><u><h2>Cortisol</h2> </u></b>
<p>Cortisol is a stress hormone that is relased by our body when we haveangative or to any
 extent  stressful experiences. It can be released in different quantities, but a prolonged
  exposure to it, especially to large amounts will have negative effects on the body.
   These negaive effects may include sleeplessness, sweating, poor concentration or memory
    problems. 
<br>
<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p><i>
<b>Martinez and Kessner, 1991</b> - They wanted to see how the activity levels of the
 neurotransmitter acetylchlorine (ACh) would effect the memory of mice, as they had to 
 go trough a maze several times. The 3 groups of mice had they ACh performace decreased, 
 left as normal and increased. They found that those mice whos ACh activity was increased
  performed the best, and those whose  was decreased perforemd the worst. 
</p></i>
<hr>
<br>

<b><u><h2>Testosterone</h2> </u></b>
<p>Testosterone is a stress hormone that is produced by the testeicles  in men and by the 
ovaries in women. It is a hormone that can stimulate hair growth and  lead to increased 
levels of aggression, which is what psychological studies mostly concentrate on. </p>
<br>
<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Dabbs et al, 1995</b> - Wanted to investigate the relations between testosterone levels
 and crimes committed by inmates. For the experiment, the testosterone levels of 692 male
  prisoners were measured. It was found that those who committed sexual crimes had
  much higher levels of this hormone than those who committed property crimes.
