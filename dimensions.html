<p> 
Cultural dimensions refers to aspects of the culture that can be measured and compared to different 
cultures around the world. There are five main aspects that can be compared all around the world, 
however only two of them must be known in greater detail by the IB. 
</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Individualism vs. collectivism</h3>
<p> 
Individualistic cultures are defined by the characteristics of the individuals within the group. 
Collectivist cultures are defined by the shared values of the group. 
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Power distance</h3>
<p> 
This shows the importance of the distance between people with power, and those who do not have power. 
Some cultures have find it more important do define borders between those who belong to the 
"upper-class", those who belong to the "middle-class" and those who are "lower-class".
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Uncertainty avoidance</h3>
<p> 
Higher uncertainty avoidance means that members of a group are more likely to avoid new 
ideas of different cultures and will be more anxious when it comes to new and ambiguous situations. 
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Masculinity and femininity</h3>
<p> 
Cultures with high masculinity tend to concentrate more on possession, success and high 
achievements, whereas more feminine cultures tend to concentrate more on emotional harmony, 
better quality of life and caring for others. 
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Long-term vs. short-term orientation</h3>
<p> 
A long-term oriented culture is more likely to use its resources in a more sustainable way,
concentrating its impact on the future. On the other hand, people in short-term oriented are 
more likely to concentrate on momentary happiness and short term enjoyments. 
</p>

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<b>Ayoun and Moreo, 2009</b> - The aim of this study was to see the difference between the 
aims of hotel managers. <br>
The study gave questioners to top-level hotel managers in Thailand and in the US, asking 
them about the strategies for their hotel. <br>
The survey found that Thai managers thought long-term goal much more important for the hotel, 
whereas managers in the US had stronger short-term goal, and did not tend to give so much importance 
to long-term plans and strategies.

<br>
<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Bond and Smith , 1966</b> - The aim of this study was to see the difference in how
well compliance works in individualistic verus in collectivist cultures.   <br>
They did a meta-analysis of 133 studies from 17 countries. <br> The meta-analysis showed 
that people from collectivist cultures are more likely to conform than people from individualistic
cultures.
