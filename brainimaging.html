<p> 
With the fast-paced development of technology, and continuons research into how new equipment can
help us explain the way our brains work, many pieces of brain imaging have been invented 
in the past century, including MRI scans, fMRI scans, CAT scans and PET scans. <br>
The IB requirement for students is to be able to compare and contrast <b>TWO</b> different types of brain imaging. 
</p>
<br>
<hr>
<b><u><h2>Positron emission tomography scans (PET scans) </h2> </u></b>
<p>
  PET scans are mainly used to detect different illnesses, infections and cancers, as it is
   great for detecting cancerous tumors at their early stages, as well as neurological problems
   such as Alzheimer´s disease. <br>
   The negative part of these scans is the injection that it involves; for the scan to work
   a small amount of radioactive substance must me injected, the tracing of which then shows
   the brain processes. Henceforth, this invasive procedure might not be so suitable for kids or 
   anyone else who is afraid of needles. 
   Furthermore, these scans can take up to 90 minutes, which is very long compared to that 
   of MRI and other scans. <br>Lastly, the main negative for these scans  is their very high cost. 
  </p>

<br>
<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Raine et al, 1997</b> - Using PET scans, Raine examined the brains of murderers and 
non-murderers, using a matched pair design. The reaserch showed that the brains of murderers
 had less activity in the <i>prefrontal lobe</i>, which is responsible for rationality and
   self-control, as well less connection and activity in the <i> corpus callosum</i>, which
    is responsible for emotional expression, compared to their non-murderer pairs. 
<br>
In this experiment Raine used PET scans because of their accuracy in displaying different 
areas of the brain <i>while</i> they are being used. This was of great use because this way 
the process of the experiment was sped up and the results obtained were more accurate. 

</i></p>

<br>

<b><u><h2>Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans (MRI scans)  </h2> </u></b>
<p>
MRI scans are aslo vey good for showing different areas of the brain, however the images 
that they show are static. The way these scans work is that a radioactive signal is sent to the 
haemoglobin in the blood, through which the activity levels of different areas of the brain can be shown. 
The images that these scans can produce are more clear than those of PET scans. Another plosive 
about them is that they are non-invasive, which might be better for children. <br>
On the other hand, because of the radiation it uses, the patients can take a maximum of 30-40 
minutes in the scanner, which requires patients to stay completely still; if in this time 
no good scan can be taken, the process must still be stopped because of the risks from radiation. <br>
Lastly, just like for PET scans, the main downside of MRI scans is their high cost. 

  </p>
  
<br>
<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Kilts et al, Coca Cola or Pepsi? </b> - The aim of this study was to investigate how
a beverage that we like effects our brains.  <br>
In this experiment MRI scans were used to look at people´s brains when they were drinking 
Coke and when they were drinking Pepsi.  <br>
The results showed that when people drank the product that they perviously said they 
preferred, the parts of the brain that relate to one´s personality lit up on the scan. 
<br>
This showed that people preferred the drink that they personally identified with. <br>
In this research, the reason for using MRI scans was the accuracy with wich it was able to map out  brain functions.
