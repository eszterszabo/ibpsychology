<p>
Biological factors, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and genetically predisposed factors
can greatly affect not only the way we remember things, but also the way we behave. This is largely 
because the way our brains are constructed in itself has a great affect on how we are able
to store memories, as well as rebuild the paths to those memories that are already stored.
This ability, of course, depends on the different hormones that are affecting our behaviour,
as well as the neurotransmitters and their abilities to send electric signals (aka. synapses).

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Martinez and Kessner, 1991</b> - The aim of this study was to see how the activity levels of the
 neurotransmitter acetylchlorine (ACh) would effect the memory of mice, as they had to 
 go trough a maze several times. <br>The 3 groups of mice had they ACh performace decreased, 
 left as normal and increased. They found that those mice whos ACh activity was increased
  performed the best, and those whose  was decreased perforemd the worst.<br>
  This showes that the biological factor of the neurotransmitter´s activity levels had a great effect on 
  the behaviour and cognition of the mice in the maze.

<i>
<b>Milner and Scoville, 1957: H.M. case study </b> - This case study examined the brain of H.M.
after his hippocampus was removed, with the aim of studying the way his brain could function without it. 
<br>
Part of H.M.´s brain was initially removed because of his severe epilepsy, as he was told by doctors that
the removal of hippocampus would make his seizures stop. They were not wrong. However, this 
also lead him to  anterograde amnesia, meaning that although he was able to remember thing from before 
the surgery, he was unable to form any new memories. <br>
This case study shows that there was a strong connection between the biology of his brain and brain functions,
and his cognitive abilities. 
</i></p>
<br>
<p>
Other studies that could also be used include K.F.´s case study, who suffered brain damage
 to the left parietal and occipital lobes during a motorcycle accident,  which also lead him 
 to short term memory problems; or any other studies related to brain functions and memory.</p>
