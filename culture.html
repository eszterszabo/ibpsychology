Models of cognition refer to theories about how our memory works. Two of such models are the 
Multi-store model (MSL) and the Working memory model (WMM). These models explain two 
different way in which memory formation and retrieval could be explained, although it is
 important to know that whilst both of these models have evidence to support them, neither
  of them can be scientifically proven.

The IB requires psychology students to know  <b>TWO</b> Models of cognition.

<b><u><h2>Culture and cultural norms </h2> </u></b>
<p>As distinguished by Triadis in 1980, there are two main elements to culture: <b>Objective </b>
aspects, such as the clothes they wera and the foods they eat and the buildings they live in, and 
<b>Subjective</b> aspects, such as their beliefs, religion and shared values. <br>
Cultural norms, on the other hand, refer to ways of behaviour that are considered to be normal, typical
or average in a specific culture. <br>
One example of this could be that in the Islamic culture women wearing a hijab is considered to be the 
norm, and it is seen unsatisfactory for women not to cover themselves up, while in other cultures is 
is common for women to wear much more revealing clothes.

<b><u><h2>Emic and Etic analysis of research on culture  </h2> </u></b>
<p>Emic and etic refers to the way that research on a specific culture can be applied to other cultures.
<br>
<b> Emic </b> behaviours are seen as non-universally applicable, as people who live in different cultures 
react to research differently.
 <br>
One example of this is seen in bed-sharing between parents and their infants. In Western cultures only 
5% of infants share their parents´ beds, while in Pacific countries,  according to some surveys, 
approximately 80% of infants share beds with their parents. <br>


<b> Etic </b> refers to the view that research can be universally applied, as people around
the world all behave in similar manners.

It is said that more complex behaviours are less likely to be emic, while simple, "core" behaviours with 
biological origins, such as sleep cycles are more likely to be etic.

<p> As this question is likely to use the command term "define", it may not need any research to support it, 
however many previously discussed studies, such as Fessler et al´s study on disgust in the

Etic behaviours, and possibly the Brixton girls study from <a href="file://localhost/Users/eszter/Desktop/compsci%20IA/conform.html" target="_blank"> conformity</a> 
and the idea of in-groups and out-groups for Emic behaviours.
