<p>
Resulting from the complexity of our society, humans have the tendency to want to simplify 
information by grouping it into different catheooiries. Often, this is done through the 
generalisation of ideas and behavioural trait that we get from certain people, and
 applying it to a general population.<br>
 For example, if we have only ever met 10 Russian girls, all of whom were good looking,
  we are likely to get the idea that all Russian girls are good looking, even though 
  this might not be correct. 
  <br>
Therefore, a stereotype can be defined as a social categorisation that is applied to a
 group of individuals, defining their belonging to a group together with a set of 
 characteristics. <br>
 Stereotypes are very similar to schemas, as they both set expectations and organize
  internal representations of people and groups.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Steele, 1995: </b> - Investigated how stereotypes would effect performance on tests. 
<br> African americans and European americans were asked to take english tests. Half of 
the participants were told that it was an articulation test, and the other half were told that
 it was a laboratory study. When told that it was an articulation test, African americans performed 
 worse, compared to when they were told that it was for a laboratory study. <br>
 This showed that because of a negative stereotype, the performance of African americans 
 was worse on the same test, when knowing that the task was about articulation.
