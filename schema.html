The Schema Theory was developed by Bartlett. He defined schemas as cognitive structures
 that organise knowledge in order for it to be stored in our memory. He wanted to 
 investigate how culture and other factors could influence both the way we perceive and
  the way we remember things. <br>
  Schemas are also responsible for forming "scripts", which will influence the way we expect 
  events to go and people to behave. Many schemas are based on stereotypes.  <br>
  This theory works based on the idea that humans are information processors, meaning that
  when receiving information, we integrate it into our memory by merging it with information
   that we already know.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Bartlett, 1932: War of the Ghosts</b> - The aim of this study was to investigate how 
social factors influence cognition and memory. <br>
Participants in this experiment were asked to read a passage, and were then asked to 
reproduce it either in a serial or a repeated manner. 
Both results showed that as the number of reproductions grew, the passage shortened. 
In both cases there were laso alteration to the story, making it more culturally fitting 
to the participants. 
<br>
The results showed that memory is inaccurate and can be influenced by our expectations and perception.
