One of the aspects that most research does not take into consideration when looking at 
cognitive processes in the brain is the way that they are effected by emotions; the way we 
think of and remember things changes based on what mood we are in, on how we feel. 
<br>
One of the theories regarding such emotional effects on memory is the idea of 
<i>Flashbulb Memory</i>. This refers to memories being embedded in our brains much more 
strongly, if we find them important, or if we fel an emotional connection to them.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Brown et al </b> - The aim of this study was to investigate whether flashbulb memory is a real 
phenomenon.  <br>
This research used qualitative methods, to find out what events people could recall the most 
vividly. 
<br>
The results showed that individuals, universally, were able to remember the death of a parent
most vividly. This connects clearly to the ideas of flashbulb memory, as child - parent relationships
have a very strong emotional bond.  
<br>
Furthermore, the researchers found that African American individuals also felt that they had
 vivid memories of civil rights leaders, and all participants asked said that they had very 
 vivid memories of the assassination of JF. Kennedy.  <br>
 These results all math with the initial idea, which states that we feel that we remember those 
 events that best to which we feel strong connections.
