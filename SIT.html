<h1 align="center" class="Title">Social Identity Theory  </h1>
</head>
<hr>

<div class="body" id="b">

<br>

<p> 
The Social Identity Theory (SIT) was developed by Tajfel and and Turner, as a basis for the 
analysis of intergroup relations. They based it on 4 main concepts in order to simplify it. 
</p>
<br>
<hr>
<h3>Social categorisation</h3>
<p> 
This is what divides all people and groups into in-groups and out-groups. In groups show 3
main aspects of behaviour: 
<ul>
<li> Self-serving bias </li>
<li>Stereotypical thinking </li>
<li> Ethnocentrism ( judging out-groups on the basis of one´s own in-group ideas and values)</li>
</ul>

</p>
<hr>
<h3>Social comparison</h3>
<p> 
This is of importance because comparing ourselves and our groups to other people and other groups
can build up a higher self-esteem. This is because when comparing, we tend to look more at our
own positive traits, while also highlighting the out-groups´ negative traits. This results 
in us believing in both our own and our in-group´s superiority compared to other groups.  
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Social identity</h3>
<p> 
Our social identity shows the way we think of ourselves as a member of the group we belong to.
This not only reflects what we think to be our position in our group and society, but can 
also influence the way we behave.  
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Positive distinctiveness</h3>
<p> 
By believing that our groups, and we as individuals are superior compared to other groups 
( as stated by social comparison), we will build up positive distinctiveness through increasing our self esteems.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Tajfel, 1971</b> - The aim of this study was to investigate in-group favouritism when assigned
based on an insignificant attribute.  <br>
This was a lab study, involving 14-15 year old school boys from Bristol. They were told that
 they were assigned into groups based on whether they preferred a painting by Kandinsky or
  one by Klee, but in reality the groups were random.  Following this, they boys had to
   assign points to members of either their own group or members of the other group.
    <br>
   The results showed that the boys showed a strong tendency to assign more points or those
    who belonged to their own group, versus those who belonged to the other group.
     <br>
    This shows that importance of social identity in a group and the tendency 
    to favour those who belong in the in-group verus those who belong to out-groups. 
    

</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
<b>Cialdini et al , 1967</b> - The aim of this study was to see the difference in the levels
 of support that a group got when positive distinctiveness was involved. 
  <br>
This study was an observation of college football supporters and their reactions to their 
teams winning and losing. 
<br>
The study found that when  the football team won, the supporters were more likely to wear
school clothing, displaying their belonging to the in-group of their college, and showing 
their connection to the winning team.
<br>
This shows that when the image of the football team, together with that of the college was bettered 
through a win, people were more likely to want to belong to that team, and show off their connection to it. 
</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>North and Lonsdale, 2009</b> - The aim of this study was to see how people form 
connections on the basis of musical taste, as an identification of group membership. 
  <br>
  The participants belonged to one of four groups: Classical fans, Rock fans, Rap fans and 
  Pop fans.The study consisted of <b>2 parts</b>. In the<b> first part</b> they were each
   given a list of 60 words, and asked to choose 10 words that describe their own group.
    The results showed that they all thought of their group in a positive manner. The
     <b>second part</b> of the study was a replication of Tajfel et al´s in-group favouritism 
     study, with participants once again having to award points to either members of their 
     in-group or members of out-groups. 
     <br>
     This study once again supports  the ideas of social identity and social categorisation.

<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>It has contributed a lot to understanding intergroup relations, as well as understanding 
prejudice against out-groups. </li>
<li>It also helped us understand the way in group norms influence conformity in groups.</li>
<li>It has further served as a basis of many other studies (such as the one by North and Lonsdale), 
promoting further research into its theories into the structure of interpersonal relationships. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Much on the research on SIT is very artificial, and the findings of these studies
are often non-applicable for real life situations. </li>
<li>As human behaviour is very complex, relying on only SIT should not always be trusted, as the 
explanations it gives for the way we behave are very vague. </li>
<li>It has the ability to <i>explain</i> certain behaviours, but it cannot <i>predict</i> 
the way people will act in certain situations. </li>
<li>SIT explains in-group favouritism well, BUT it does not explain the often displayed violent
behaviour against out-groups. </li>
<li>It does not explain why in some cases the group identity is stronger, while in others 
personal identity is. </li>
</ul>
