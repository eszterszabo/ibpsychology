The Social Learning Theory (SLT) is a concept proposed by Bandura, which states that 
learning is a cognitive process, but it takes place in a social context. He believed that 
it takes place through experience, observations or directly received instructions.  <br>
  Schemas are also responsible for forming "scripts", which will influence the way we expect 
  events to go and people to behave. Many schemas are based on stereotypes.  <br>
  This theory works based on the idea that humans are information processors, meaning that
  when receiving information, we integrate it into our memory by merging it with information
   that we already know.

<i><h4>RESEARCH:</h4></i>
<p>
<i>
<b>Bandura et al , 1961: The Bobo doll experiment</b> - The aim of this study was to investigate how 
social factors influence cognition and memory. <br>
In this experiment, children were divided into 2 groups. Group 1 saw adults playing nicely 
with the Bobo doll, whereas participants in Group 2 witnessed adults being violent with the 
Bobo doll, kicking and punching it. Following this, each child was put into a room with the Bobo doll.
<br>
The results showed that children who observed the violently behaving adults were also more
likely to punch and kick the Bobo doll. This shows that children learn through observation, 
providing strong evidence for the SLT.
