<b><u><h3>1. Animal reseach can provide insight into human behaviour</h3> </u></b>
<br>
<i>RESEARCH:</i>
<p>
<b>Martinez and Kessner, 1991</b> - They wanted to see how the activity levels of the neurotransmotter acetylchlorine (ACh) would effect the memory of mice, as they had to go trough a maze several times. The 3 groups of mice had they ACh performace decreased, left as normal and increased. They found that those mice whos ACh activity was increased performed the best, and those whose  was decreased perforemd the worst.

<b><u><h3>2. There are biological explanations of behaviour </h3> </u></b>
<br>

<i>RESEARCH:</i>
<p>
<b>Raine et al, 1997</b>- Using PET scans, Raine examined the brains of murderers and non-murderers, using a matched pair design. The reaserch showed that the brains of murderers had less activity in areas responsible for self-control, rationality and emotional expression, compared to their non-murderer pairs. 



<br>

<b><u><h3>3. To some extent, human behaviour is genetically based </h3> </u></b>

<br>
 
<i>RESEARCH:</i>
<p>
<b>Bouchard et al</b>-  Bouchard conducted reserch on monozygotic twins, and how their IQs would change if they were raised together or apart. He found that the IQs of the twins  would be approximately the same, regardless if they were raised  together or apart, leading him to the conclusion that their IQs were genetically based.
